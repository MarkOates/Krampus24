ARCHIVE: CAPTAIN'S LOG

This will probably be the most difficult log I ever have to make.  I don't even know where to start.

I found myself awakened in my cryopod ahead of schedule. After gaining some consciousness to know where I was, I managed to loosen the door latch and make my way out of the pod.

I was mortified when I saw the red light on my cryopod's control panel - containment failure.

To make matters worse, I then saw today's date.

I quickly went to check the cryopods of my crewmates. After noticing other similar types of cryopod malfunctions, I was relieved at least to know that everyone was still alive.

It appeared that all the pods would suffer the same or similar malfunction within the next weeks, months, and at best years. This means that the entire crew would be awakened from cryostasis - almost 120 years ahead of schedule.

I awakened my chief medical officer from the cryopod first, then our engineer.

Giving it some time, we discussed it and to take the words from my engineer...

---PAGE---

"The ramifications of this failure cannot be understated."

We agreed, collectively, to slowly awaken the crew one-by-one on manual release.

We didn't know if the pod failures could result in loss-of-life, so we decided the right course of action was to awaken them to guarantee everyone's survival.

... If you can call this survival.

So now we begin the journey of finding a way to live, considering the devastating circumstances that have been forced upon us.

I've told my first medical officer to prioritize the well-being of our crew. Let's hope he can keep us all afloat.
