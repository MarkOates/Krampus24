ARCHIVE: CAPTAIN'S LOG

The mess hall is, ironically, turning into a bit of a mess.  One of the tiles in the flooring cracked when one of the zoo animals leaked some "simulant fluid".

It didn't seem so bad at first but then we found out it got between the boards and seems to have corroded the plating a bit.

Since it never got properly fixed at the time, everyone just walked over it and slowly the plating and tiles around it started to go.

Everyone's too preoccupied with the cute animal friends to want to fix it and, since the repair robots were mostly converted into animal pets there aren't any working robots around to do the repairs.

Hmm, now that I think about it, does anybody on the ship even know how to repair the flooring?  I'll ask Terry.
