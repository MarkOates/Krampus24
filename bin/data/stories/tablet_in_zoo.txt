ARCHIVE: CAPTAIN'S LOG

Welp, we finally have it. The zoo. Or, should I say, farm? Myself and my shipmates still haven't come to an agreement on what we should call it.

---PAGE---

Anyway, the whole reason we put this zoofarm thing together is because we decided we had too many years in deep space, and we missed contact with animals.

The nature and vacation programs in the VR room just didn't quite seem to cut it. So, we took some of our ship's robots and converted them into makeshift animal companions.

Terry did the programming.  I feel like he still has some skills to learn because some of the animals are a bit, uh, well... glitchy.  I'm not sure what to expect from them from time to time. One moment they're adorable, another moment they're chewing on cables.  But maybe that's actually kinda normal.

Either way, they're quite cute little buggers. I'm kinda feeling a bit attached to one of them, in particular.

Now I just hope we can restore at least a few of them back to repair robots because there's a loose tile on the floor in the mess hall (2nd floor) that needs repairing.  It doesn't seem to be a big problem right now because people are just kinda working around it.
