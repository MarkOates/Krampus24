ARCHIVE: CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER'S LOG

Morale seems to be much higher since we moved forward on the animal construction project.

I was skeptical at first, but then Hugo showed one of his initial animal designs. I could tell he seemed very excited and, to shoot down any spark of motivation would be a mistake at this point in our mission.

But, I would be lying if I didn't mention that my real motivation was how cute and adorable Hugo's chicken was. It looked kinda wobbly, but in a cute way.

Anyway, one thing led to another, and the next thing I know is I've willfully volunteered to convert our ship's medical bay into an animal repair station. Each new animal design is a great advancement over the one before.

We've even gone as far as to synchronize their software operating system - we can upgrade all the animals at the same time.

Most importantly, we just pushed the newest upgrade. It gives every animal the following feature:

1. In the event of an emergency, the animal will go to the escape pod. (Manual deployment of the escape pod is still required).
